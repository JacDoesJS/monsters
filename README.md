Virgin Media tech assessment exercise using https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/2014/monsters/

As a user I want to be able to search for more information about specific monsters.
If the monster isn't in the database, I want to receive a human-readable error message.
For monsters with lots of properties, I want the option to see more information.
